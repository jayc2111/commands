## human speech
| frequency f | wavelength λ [m] | occurance |
| - | - | - |
| 16 Hz   | 21,44 m | min. audible |
| 200 Hz  |  1,72 m | min. speech |
| 300 Hz  |  1,1 m  | min. phone |
| 3,4 kHz |  10 cm  | max. phone |
| 5 kHz   | 6,86 cm | max. speech |
| 20 kHz  | 1,72 cm | max. audible |

## near field/ far field
Depends on wavelength:
- r = λ: 9° phase shift
- r = 2λ: 4,4° phase shift

**near field**:  
- close to the acoustic source
- a lot of interferences
- `p ~ 1/r` and `v ~ 1/r²`

**far field**:  
- pressure and velocity have same phase
- pressure level lower
- `p ~ 1/r` and `v ~ 1/r`

## equivalence: electric and acoustic laws
| ohm's law | acoustics law |
| - | - |
| voltage U [V]   | sound pressure p [N/m²] |
| current I [A]   | particale velocity v [m/s] |
| resitance R [Ω] | acoustic impedance Z [Ns/m³] |
| power P [W]     | sound intensity I [W/m²] |
